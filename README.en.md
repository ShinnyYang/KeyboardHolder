# KeyboardHolder

A supplement to macos comes with an app that regrets the "automatically switch to document to input method" feature.

# The main function
-The app switches back and forth, keeping the input method used before the app was cut out.
-Custom app input method configuration
-Floating window support

# stand by
If the app helps you trouble with input method switching, and you think it is a great app, please start with `Star`.
